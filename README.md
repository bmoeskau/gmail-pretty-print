gmail-pretty-print
==================

Strip the logo and email header/footer crap when printing from Gmail. Nothing more, nothing less.

`gmail-pretty-print.js` is the uncompressed source for debugging and poking fun at.

`gmail-pretty-print-bookmarklet.js` is compressed and tested as a bookmarklet that can be saved and accessed directly from the browser bookmark bar. Only tested in Chrome, but might work in other places.
